## Dashboard Usage

When you open the app for the first time, you'll be greeted by the curated Dashboard view. There will be quite a few information getting into your eyes in the very moment, but don't feel overwhelmed, it's <s>not</s> rocket science.

Dashbord supplies you with basic visual info about next and previous launch, weather in all the launch facilities and Starlink program progress (active satellites count).
Let's focus on a few eye-catching features, to make you feel more comfy.
<ol>
  <li><b>Available routes</b><br/>Piece of cake, you can handle that. 🍰</li>
  <li><b>Settings tweaker</b><br/>Use it to tweak windspeed and temperature units which are used primarly in the <b>Launch facilities</b> widget and some more places across the app. You can also change the timezone for launches to your local time, as UTC is set to default. ⚙️</li>
  <li><b>See more button</b></br>Dive into mission details, lovely. ✨</li>
  <li><b>Mission Patch</b><br/>Depending on availability this window contains either a mission patch, or a rocket logo, if a patch isn't yet available. 🚀</li>
</ol>
